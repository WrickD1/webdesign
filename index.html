            <h2>The Journey</h2>
            <p>We travel, some of us forever, to seek other places, other lives, other souls. We travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape us. We are all on a journey through life, doing our best weather the storms and to enjoy precious moments with family and friends.</p>

            <h2>Vacation</h2>
            <p>Between vacations, many daydream about what adventures the next trip holds. You can spend your days switching back and forth from looking at your favourite travel photos to trying to go about your day to day life. But a few friendly reminders that the next adventure is closer than you think can help you put your wanderlust to rest.</p>
